Slogro & Slogro2
By Devin Cook


These two programs are implementations of the SLOGRO fractal process
described in Scientific American - Dec 1988.

Slogro.EXE is the standerd implementation of SLOGRO.

Slogro2.EXE has is roughly the same process except that the main particle
movement routine has been redone in assembly ( FRAC.ASM ), and an alteration
has been done to the premise, whereby instead of the circle being a fixed
radius, it is now a changing radius, starting at 10 pixels and working its
way to 100.  This speeds things up but a factor of 20!  As the resting
particles approach the radius, the circle is backed off, as to allow for
a truly random process to still take place.

The plotter routines were written for a Comscriber plotter, but could easily
be altered to make a box on the paper at the relative location of the particle
on any plotter.

Finally the graphics are set up to run with a herc graphic card, but it should
be fairly easy to alter it to work with any graphics system.
