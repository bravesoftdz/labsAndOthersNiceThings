###[Modeling of Systems](/vira-lytvyn/ModelingOfSystems) by [Boyko Ya.V.]()
This folder contains three first laboratory work and repot to each of them
1. Is written in JavaScript. Results of algorithms calculations are logged in browser console (just press ```F12``` to see this). Than I've copied them into MS Exel document and draw diagramth you see in report. You may also use Google charts for the same. But drawing charts via D3.js of similar JS libraris would be even better.
2. Is implemented in Pascal. Report contains all related information and code fragments. Folder also contais visual element made with Paint.NET.
3. Program Qschema is written in C#. Report contains description of development proces and received results.
